									<h2>1A - Introduction to Functions</h2>

									<h3>What is a function?</h3>
									<p>A <b>function</b> is a rule that receives an input (the x-value) and produces a single output (the y-value). In this definition, it is important to note the words "single output", as this will distinguish whether an equation represents a function or a relation. A straightforward way of distinguishing between a function and a relation is through the vertical line test.</p>
									<div class="box">
										<p><b>Vertical-line test:</b> any vertical line drawn on the graph of a function must only intercept the graph once.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-2 col-12-medium"></div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_passverticallinetest.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>\(y=x^2\) passes the vertical line test and is a function</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_failverticallinetest.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>\(y^2=x\) fails the vertical line test and is not a function<b> wrong</b></p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-2 col-12-medium"></div>
									</div>
									<p>Although we have noted that the left graph is a function, it is important to realise that it is also a relation. A relation is simply a set of inputs and outputs, and therefore all functions are relations.</p>

									<h3>Function Notation</h3>
									<p>Functions are most commonly denoted by the symbol <b>\(f(x)\)</b> (read as "f-of-x"), which means that an equation named \(f\), has an input variable called \(x\). Each function may be represented differently, such as; \(y, g(x), v(t), A(r)\), in these cases all that is changing is the name of the function and which symbol we choose to represent the input variable. </p>
									<p>For a function, \(f(x)=5x^2\)  we can see that the function is dependent on \(x\) and replacing the variable \(x\) with a number or expression will accordingly replace all the \(x\)'s in the function's rule.</p>
									<p>
											$$\begin{align} \text{For example:  } f(x)&=10x^2+x \\
											&\implies f(5)=10∗5^2+5=255\\
											&\implies f(√x)=10(√x)^2+√x=10x+√x\\
											&\implies f(x+5)=10(x+5)^2+(x+5)=10x^2+101x+255 \end{align} $$
									</p>
									<p>It is also important, and may seem obvious, to remember that functions are exactly the same as "\(y\)", using functions just allows greater flexibility and provides more information, especially when keeping track of multiple formulas.</p>

									<h3>Types of Correspondence</h3>
									<p>Functions and relations can be classified according to the correspondence between inputs and outputs, resulting in four possible types. These types can each be viewed as the "number of \(x\)-values"-to-"number of \(y\)-values", and are as follows:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left:72px;margin-top:-18px">
										<li><b><i>One-to-one</i></b> ("one \(x\)-value to one \(y\)-value")</li>
										<li><b><i>Many-to-one</i></b> ("many \(x\)-values to one \(y\)-value")</li>
										<li><b><i>One-to-many</i></b> ("one \(x\)-values to many \(y\)-value")</li>
										<li><b><i>Many-to-many</i></b> ("many \(x\)-values to many \(y\)-value")</li>
									</ul>
									<p>	We see that one-to-one and many-to-one correspondences pass vertical line test and are therefore functions. Whilst one-to-many and many-to-many correspondences do not pass the vertical and are therefore not functions (but are relations)</p>

									<!-- 1B - Domain and Range -->
									<h2>1B - Domain and Range</h2>

									<h3>Maximal/Implied Domain</h3>
									<p>Functions are often written without specifying a domain, in this case a function will take on its maximal or implied domain - this is the largest subset of all real numbers, R for which the function's rule will be defined. To simplify things, we only need to look for two cases in which the maximal domain of a function is restricted.</p>
									<p>The <b>maximal domain</b> of any function must exclude:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left:72px;margin-top:-18px">
										<li>Any input that would result in a denominator becoming zero (dividing by zero - resulting in the graph having a vertical asymptote and being discontinuous)</li>
										<li>Any input that would result in a negative number in a square root (no real solutions - resulting in the graph not existing)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										$$\begin{align} f(x)&=\sqrt{x+2} \\
										&\implies \text{the maximal domain is } x \geq -2 \text{ or } x \in [-2, \infty)\\
										f(x)&=\frac{1}{x-2} \\
										&\implies \text{the maximal domain is } x \in \mathbb{R}\setminus \{2\} \end{align} $$
									</p>
									<p>	In the following sections, where our focus is on polynomial functions, the maximal or implied domains will always be \(\mathbb{R}\). Note that there may be additional cases to these two if the function appears in an application style question. A common example is when the question involves time as the input variable, since time cannot logically be negative this implies that the domain is restricted from negative numbers regardless of the function's rule.

									<!-- 1C - Linear Functions -->
									<h2>1C - Linear Functions</h2>

									<p>The linear function is the simplest polynomial that we will encounter and is also the simplest function for us to graph - a straight line.</p>

									<h3>Gradient</h3>
									<p>The gradient, or slope, of a linear function represents the increase (or decrease) in the y-direction for every unit travelled in the x-direction. his can be calculated through the use of any two points on the line; \((x_1,y_1 )\)  and \((x_2,y_2 )\), and the rise over run formula: \(m=\frac{y_2−y_1 }{x_2−x_1}\). Also recall that regardless of which two points we have chosen on the linear function, the gradient will be the same since it is a straight line - however, this will not be the case for other functions, such as quadratics.</p>
									<p>Other important formulas regarding the gradient involve parallel lines, which will share the same gradient, and perpendicular lines, which will evaluate to -1 when the gradients are multiplied.</p>
									<ul style="padding-left:72px;margin-top:-18px">
										<li>For parallel lines: \(m_1=m_2\)</li>
										<li>For perpendicular lines \(m_1 m_2=−1\) </li>
									</ul>
									<p>	It will also be useful to convert between the gradient, \(m\), and the angle of the slope, by using \(m=tan^-1(θ)\), where θ is the angle between the line and the positive direction of the x-axis.</p>

									<h3>Equation of a Linear Function</h3>
									<p>The equation of a linear function should always be expressed in the gradient-intercept form: \(y=mx+c\), where \(m\) is the gradient and \(c\) is the \(y\)-intercept. This is the form that examiners will expect answers to be in, unless specified otherwise. Another form that will be useful for working out is \(y−y_1=m(x−x_1)\), this involves a point knowing a point on the line \((x_1,y_1 )\)  and the gradient \(m\). However, when using this form remember to rearrange to \(y=mx+c\) for the final answer.</p>

									<h2>1D - Quadratic Functions</h2>

									<h3>Graphing Quadratic Functions</h3>
									<p>Quadratic functions are second degree polynomials, that are graphed as parabolas and are commonly expressed in the form \(ax^2+bx+c\). However, they can be expressed in several other forms which we will see below. Regardless of what form the equation is we see that:</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-2 col-12-medium"></div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_uprightquadratic.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>if the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive (i.e. \(a > 0\)), the function is an upright parabola with a minimum turning point</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_inversequadratic.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>if the coefficient of \(x^2\) is negative (i.e. \(a < 0\)), the function is an inverse parabola with a maximum turning point</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-2 col-12-medium"></div>
									</div>

									<h3>Different Forms of Quadratic Functions</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>General form, \(y = ax^2 + bx +c\)</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>In the general form, \(c\) is the y−intercept and x−intercepts are found by solving \(ax^2+bx+c=0\). For the turning point, the axis of symmetry of the parabola is \(x=−\frac{b}{2a}\), which is the x-coordinate of the turning point and the y-coordinate can be found by substituting this into the parabola's equation.  </p>
											<p>The general form provides an easy way of getting an idea of the shape and location of the parabola by using the discriminant \(\Delta=b^2−4ac\). Other forms do not have the constant \(c\) in their equations and thus must be expanded into the general form first in order to use the discriminant.</p>
											<div class="table-wrapper">
												<table class="alt">
													<tbody>
													<tr>
														<td></td>
														<td>\(\Delta < 0\)</td>
														<td>\(\Delta = 0\)</td>
														<td>\(\Delta > 0\)</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>\(a > 0\)</td>
														<td>no x-intercepts, minimum turning point</td>
														<td>one x-intercept, minimum turning point</td>
														<td>two x-intercepts, minimum turning point</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>\(a < 0\)</td>
														<td>no x-intercepts, maximum turning point</td>
														<td>one x-intercept, maximum turning point</td>
														<td>two x-intercepts, maximum turning point</td>
													</tr>
													</tbody>
												</table>
											</div>
										</dd>
										<dt>Turning point form, \(y=a(x−h)^2+k\)</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>In the turning point form, the quadratic has a turning point at \((h,k)\), and an axis of symmetry is \(x=h\) (since a parabola is symmetrical about its turning point). To obtain the turning point form, complete the square on the general form \(y=ax^2+bx+c\). Conversely, to obtain the general form, expand the turning point form \(y=a(x−h^2+k)\).</p>
											<p>It is also important to realise why the turning point form works, that is through transformations. Consider the simplest parabola, \(y=x^2\)  with turning point at the origin (0,0). If we first apply a dilation from the x-axis of a factor \(a\), then translate \(h\) units in the positive x-direction and \(k\) units in the positive y-direction we will see that the turning point is now \((h,k)\) and the parabola equation is now in the turning point form, \(y=a(x−h)^2+k\).</p>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-2 col-12-medium"></div>
												<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_turningpoint1.png" alt="" /></span>
													<p>\(y=-\frac{1}{2} (x-1)^2 + 3\) has a turning point at \((1, 3)\)</p>
												</div>
												<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_turningpoint2.png" alt="" /></span>
													<p>\(y=2(x+1)^2 - 2\) has a turning point at \((-1, -2)\)</p>
												</div>
											</div>
										</dd>
										<dt>Factorised (or x-intercept) form,  \(y=a(x−x_1 )(x−x_2)\)</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>In the factorised or x-intercept form, the quadratic has x-intercepts at \(x_1\), and \(x_2\)  and the x-coordinate of the turning point is the midpoint between the two x-intercepts, \(x=\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}\). The y-coordinate of the turning point can then be found by substituting this value into the parabola's equation. To obtain the x-intercept form, factorise the general form \(y=ax^2+bx+c\). Conversely expanding the x-intercept form \(y=a(x−x_1)(x−x_2)\)  will obtain the general form. Note that since a quadratic may not always have real solutions (if \(\triangle < 0\)) the x-intercept form may not always be possible.</p>
											<p>Note that there will be a <b>repeated factor</b> if \(x_1 = x_2\). This occurs when the turning point is on the x-axis and thus there is only one x-intercept. In this case the quadratic would be in the factorised form: \(y=a(x−x_1 )^2\), which is equivalent to the turning point form, \(y=a(x−h)^2+k\) with \(k=0\) (i.e. the function has no vertical translation). </p>

													<p>\(y=2(x+\frac{1}{2})^2\) has a x-intercept at \((-\frac{1}{2} , 0)\) (note the repeated factor means that the turning point is equal to the x-intercept)</p>

									<h3>Key Features</h3>
									<p>We have seen that when graphing quadratic functions there are a variety of forms that are possible and provide key features of the parabola. The coordinates of these key features must be labelled onto the graph (unless stated otherwise), and include:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left:72px;margin-top:-18px">
										<li>the y-intercept</li>
										<li>any x-intercepts</li>
										<li>the turning point</li>
										<li>any endpoints (if the domain is restricted)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Note that the axis of symmetry does not need to be labelled - although you may choose to do so if it helps you in sketching the parabola.</p>

									<!-- 1E - Cubic Functions -->
									<h2>1E - Cubic Functions</h2>

									<h3>Points of Inflection</h3>
									<p>Cubics are third degree polynomials and are commonly expressed in the form: \(y=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d\). Cubics introduces us to a new feature of a curve - the <b>point of inflection</b>. These are points at which a change in the direction of curvature occurs, from concave to convex, or vice versa. A simplified way to view points of inflection,  is the points at which the curve transitions between a "smiley" (an upright parabola) and a "frowney" (an inverse parabola)</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-3 col-12-medium"></div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_pointofinflection.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>For example: the point of inflection above represents the point in which the graph changes from an inverse parabola (left of the point) to an upright parabola (right of the point)</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-3 col-12-medium"></div>
									</div>
									<p>A cubic will always have exactly one point of inflection, and only polynomials with higher degrees may have more points of inflection - thus the functions we have previously looked at (the linear and quadratic) do not have points of inflection. Inflection points may also be stationary points, wherein a tangent at that point will be horizontal. Visually, these will be points where the direction of curvature changes on a "flat" line. Such points are called <b>stationary points of inflection</b>.</p>

									<h3>Graphing Cubic Functions</h3>
									<p>The simplest cubic functions are the equations \(y=x^3\)  and \(y=−x^3\), and when graphed look like:</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-3 col-12-medium"></div>
										<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_cubicx3.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>\(y=x^3\)</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
											<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_cubic-x3.png" alt="" /></span>
											<p>\(y=−x^3\)</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-3 col-12-medium"></div>
									</div>
									<p>	Through these two diagrams we can observe that the long-term behaviour of the general cubic function is dependent on the sign of \(a\), the coefficient of the \(x^3\) term. For the general cubic form, \(y=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d\), from the left of the graph (i.e. \(−\infty\) x−coordinates) to the right of the graph (i.e. \(+\infty\) x−coordinates), we see that:</p>
									<ul style="padding-left:72px;margin-top:-18px">
										<li>if \(a>0\), then the y-coordinates of the graph travels from \(−\infty\) to \(+\infty\)</li>
										<li>if \(a<0\), then the y-coordinates of the graph travels from \(+\infty\) to \(-\infty\)</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Different Forms of Cubic Functions</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt>Stationary point of inflection form, \(y = a(x-h)^3 + k\)</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>In this form, the cubic function has a stationary point of inflection at \((h,k)\) and only one x−intercept. The cubics, \(y=x^3\)  and \(y=−x^3\)  above are in this form and we can see that their stationary point of inflection is at the origin, \((0,0)\) and their only x−intercept is also at the origin.</p>
											<p>This form is similar to the turning point form of quadratic functions, and is similarly derived through transformations, from the equation \(y=x^3\). The stationary point of inflection begins at origin and remains constant under dilations, then translations of \(h\) units in the positive x-direction and translations of \(k\) units in the positive y-direction transform the point into \((h,k)\).</p>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-2 col-12-medium"></div>
												<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_turningpoint1.png" alt="" /></span>
													<p>\(y=-(x+3)^3 + 1\) has a turning point at \((-3, 1)\)</p>
												</div>
												<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_turningpoint2.png" alt="" /></span>
													<p>\(y=-(x+1)^3 + \frac{1}{2}\) has a turning point at \((1, \frac{1}{2})\)</p>
												</div>
											</div>
										</dd>
										<dt>Factorised (or x-intercept) form,  \(y=a(x−m)(x−n)(x-p)\)</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>In the factorised form the cubic function is expressed as the product of its linear factors and since a cubic may have up to three distinct, linear factors, there may be up to three x-intercepts. If there are three linear factors; that is, y=a(x−m)(x−n)(x−p), then the graph will cut the x-axis at each of the three roots, at \(x=m\), \(x=n\) and \(x=p\). If there is one factor that is repeated twice (i.e. a multiplicity of 2) and another linear factor; that is, \(y=a(x−m)^2 (x−n)\), then the graph will touch the x-axis as a turning point at the root with multiplicity of 2, \(x=m\), and cut the x-axis at the other root, \(x=n\).</p>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-2 col-12-medium"></div>
												<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_xintercept1.png" alt="" /></span>
													<p>\(y=-\frac{1}{2} (x+1)(x-2)\) has x-intercepts at \((-1 , 0)\) and \((2 , 0)\)</p>
												</div>
												<div class="col-3 col-12-medium">
													<span class="image fit"><img src="images/mm_ch1_xintercept2.png" alt="" /></span>
													<p>\(y=2(x+\frac{1}{2})^2\) has a x-intercepts at \((-\frac{1}{2} , 0)\) (note the repeated factor means that the turning point is equal to the x-intercept)</p>
												</div>
											</div>
											<p>Cubic functions with only one linear factor with a multiplicity of 3 would be in the equivalent form as the stationary point of inflection form, \(y=a(x−h^3+k\), where \(k=0\) (i.e. the function has no vertical translation). Note that, unlike the quadratic functions, turning points of the cubic are not symmetrically placed in the middle of x-intercepts.</p>
											<p>Some cubic functions may also have one linear factor and one irreducible quadratic factor, in the form \(y=a(x−m)(x^2+n)\), where n is positive. In this case, the factor \(x^2+n\) is a quadratic that cannot be factorised (since its determinant will be negative) and the graph will only cut the x-axis once at \(x=m\). Other key features of the graph are difficult to derive in this form (such as turning points and points of inflection) and will require either calculus or technology to graph. </p>
